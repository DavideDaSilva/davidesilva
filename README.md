### Work Experience

**Data Science and Analytics Independent Consultant (_December 2023 - Present_)**
- Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Model Development: Led the end-to-end development of machine learning models, focusing on both supervised and unsupervised techniques to uncover actionable insights and drive business decisions.
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Designed and implemented robust **ETL** processes to extract data from diverse sources, transform it into a suitable format, and load it into data storage systems, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Implemented data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines to ensure high-quality input data for model training, including handling missing data, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis **(EDA)**: Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis using **Python** libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
- Model Evaluation and Optimization: Utilized a range of evaluation metrics and techniques to assess model performance, including cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods to improve predictive accuracy.
- Visualization and Reporting: Created compelling visualizations and reports to communicate complex analytical findings to non-technical stakeholders, ensuring clear and actionable insights.


**Web Systems Developer @ Khomp Indústria e Comércio ltda. (_December 2021 - December 2023_)**

**Responsibilities**:
- Development of the Insight platform (SaaS), an analytics (BI) solution for telephony systems, offering historical and real-time performance data such as Network Effectiveness Ratio (NER), Answer Seizure Ratio (ASR), Average Call Duration (ACD), and Call Attempts Per Second (CAPS) for call centers, carriers, and companies with high call volumes. This solution significantly improved the operational efficiency of companies both nationally and internationally (Colombia, Chile, USA).
- Adaptation of the Insight platform for different time zones in countries such as Mexico, Colombia, and the USA, named “Insight Multiple Country.”
- Release and monitoring of new versions of the Insight product.
- Project management using Redmine.
- Creation and maintenance of reports.
- Software documentation and testing.
- Programming Languages and Tools Used:
  - Python
  - TypeScript
  - Front-end: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PUG/Jade, jQuery, D3.js
  - Back-end: Node.js, PostgreSQL
  - API Testing and Debugging: Insomnia and Postman
  - Tools: Git (GitLab and GitHub), Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Linux

**Junior Web Systems Developer @ Empresa Júnior da Engenharia de Computação (EJEC-UFSC) - (_September 2019 to December 2020_)**
- Experience as a Project Management Advisor, researching and implementing the Function Point Analysis (FPA) pricing technique to ensure precise product pricing, and training the team in its use.
- Experience as a web systems developer, utilizing languages and tools such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, and React.

### Listed projects
Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), I developed a model to identify potential customers for bank loans. This method allowed for maximizing the conversion rate and reducing marketing costs. The project was carried out using **Python** and the libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and **scikit-learn**.
