- Experience as a web systems developer, utilizing languages and tools such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, and React.

### Projects
Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), I developed a model to identify potential customers for bank loans. This method allowed for maximizing the conversion rate and reducing marketing costs. The project was carried out using Python and the libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and scikit-learn.
